    Hello People!, Myself Dev, and I'm creating this repository to learn GitHub.
    So far I have learned about GitHub basic functions, like creating Repository 
    and its deployment.

    I have created few CLI apps using JavaScript.

    My Hobbies are playing Guitar, Singing, and watching Videos on youtube.
